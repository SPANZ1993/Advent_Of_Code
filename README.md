# Advent of Code

## "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles."

### This is a repo containing my Advent of Code solutions. I am starting on the 2023 puzzles but may do more in the future.  As of now, all exercises are done in Python.

## To Run:
  1) Create an account on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and download the necessary input data.
  2) Create an 'Input' folder under the main project root, as well as a year folder, and place the input data in a text file in that directory. That is, the solution notebook __/Solutions/2023/AOC_2023_3.ipynb__ will expect to find an input file at __/Input/2023/3.txt__
  3) Run the Jupyter Notebook

##### environment.yaml is included to generate the Python environment
